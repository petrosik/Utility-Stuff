# **About**
Just a collection of code that i use in most of my projects.   
[Documentation](https://petrosik.github.io/Utility-Stuff/)
# **Usage**
If you want to use it, either:
- ### Build on your own
    Download the rep and build it. it will give you a `.dll` and `.xml` file you can jut use in your projects.
- ### Release
    If i donÅ¥ forget and the release is up-to date you can just download that.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to keep the xml next to the dll, if you want descriptions.
